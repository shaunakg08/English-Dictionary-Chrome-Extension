## The Creator
Hi, I am Shaunak Guchhait. I am a student keen to know and learn everything about technology. In this modern world people are advancing with technology at a very high rate and creating wonderful and useful things with their creative mind. Being a enthusiastic coder and tech geek, I also intend to contribute not great but small creations of my own. I also wish to help others like me who want to learn to code and create great things.
